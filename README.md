# R script to calculate and validate monthly clear sky fluxes at BSRN stations

This script contains all code to reproduce the analysis which is described in 
    
Renner, M., M. Wild, M. Schwarz, and A. Kleidon.
    **Estimating Shortwave Clear-Sky Fluxes from Hourly Global
    Radiation Records by Quantile Regression.**
    Earth and Space Science, 2019.
    https://doi.org/10.1029/2019EA000686. 
    
The script will merge the BSRN radiation data, perform aggregation to half-hourly values and apply the novel quantile regression approach to estimate the fractional clear-sky solar radiation from sub-daily records of global radiation.
The script also allows to reproduce the figures in the above mentioned manuscript. 

## Instructions    
### Install dependencies 
To use the script you need to install the related R package **cleaRskyQuantileRegression**, and the **phaselag** package from github:
```R
library(devtools)
install_github("laubblatt/cleaRskyQuantileRegression")
install_github("laubblatt/phaselag")
 ```

## Download the data from BSRN
Here I used a snapshot which contains all data in a different format. Note, that you need about 3.7GB space.

### Source Reference:
KÃ¶nig-Langlo, Gert; Driemel, Amelie; Raffel, Bonnie; Sieger, Rainer (2015): BSRN snapshot 2015-09, links to zip archives. PANGAEA, https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.852720

```bash
cd YOUR_DATA_FOLDER 
wget http://hs.pangaea.de/Projects/BSRN/2015-09_snapshot/radiation.zip
unzip radiation.zip
```


## Merge data 
into a R data.table format using (R/read_BSRN_2datatable.r) 
You will need to set the variable *pdat* in this file to let R know where the data is stored in your system. 
```R
source("R/read_BSRN_2datatable.r") 
 ```

## Aggregate data 
BSRN data is stored in minutes. This script will process these and aggregate data into 30min and 60min values, using the aggregation scheme of Driemel et al., 2011. 
```R
source("R/read_BSRN_aggregate.r") 
 ```

## Perfrom the Quantile regression 
This will use the 30min and 60min data and derived the clear sky estimates for each month:

```R
source("R/clearsky_BSRN_quantreg.r") 
 ```

## Analyse output and create figures
This will compare with estimates of the quasi-standard *Long and Ackerman 2000 JGR* method. 
The data for comparison can be obtained from Prof. Martin Wild, ETH. 
```R
source("R/clearsky_BSRN_quantreg_figures.r") 
 ```
